# F5-TTS Configuration
# Copy these settings to your main .env file

# === F5-TTS Settings ===
# Probability of generating audio response instead of text (0.0 to 1.0)
TTS_PROBABILITY=0.3

# Output directory for generated audio files
TTS_OUTPUT_DIR=/tmp/tts_audio

# Path to local custom voice file for voice cloning
# Should be a clear audio sample, 3-10 seconds, mono, 24kHz recommended
CUSTOM_VOICE_PATH=./sample_audio_deija.wav

# === Example Usage ===
# 1. Set TTS_PROBABILITY to control how often audio responses are generated
#    0.0 = never, 0.3 = 30% of the time, 1.0 = always
# 
# 2. Set CUSTOM_VOICE_PATH to your voice sample file
#    - Use a clear recording of the voice you want to clone
#    - 3-10 seconds duration is ideal
#    - Remove background noise
#    - Mono audio, 24kHz sample rate recommended
#
# 3. TTS_OUTPUT_DIR will store generated audio files
#    - Make sure the directory is writable
#    - For production, use a permanent storage location
#    - For AWS, consider using S3 for audio file storage

# === Voice Sample Guidelines ===
# Good voice samples:
# - Clear speech without background noise
# - Natural speaking pace (not too fast/slow)
# - Good audio quality (no distortion/clipping)
# - 3-10 seconds of continuous speech
# - Single speaker only
#
# Poor voice samples:
# - Noisy/distorted audio
# - Multiple speakers
# - Very short clips (< 2 seconds)
# - Very long clips (> 30 seconds)
# - Music or non-speech content
